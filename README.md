# TypeSpeedTest
Typing speed tester that lets you measure the speed of whatever input you want.

Have you ever wanted to measure how quickly you can type, but were being impeded by online typing tests wanting you to type something that they wanted?  Look no further!  This test lets you type for as long as you want, making as many errors as you want, and measures the results anyways.  Because checking for typos can be done afterwards.

## Usage
Run the script in PowerShell:
```ps1
./get-WordCount.ps1
```
You will be given the following prompt:
```
The timer will begin when you hit Enter [Return]. 
Type as long as you want.
Press Enter [Return] again whenever you're done:
```
Whenever you press Enter, the timer begins.  Type as many or as few words as you want, and then press Enter again to stop the timer.  A few basic stats will be provided for what you wrote.  For example:
```
The timer will begin when you hit Enter [Return]. 
Type as long as you want.
Press Enter [Return] again whenever you're done:
